        Fewer than one-third of the national parks charge entrance fees. You can obtain park entrance passes by visiting

        prior to your visit. (See the park search to locate a specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes
        available, including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer entrance to more than 2,000 federal
        recreation sites in addition to the national parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer
        passes). Learn more about the America the Beautiful - The National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass.
